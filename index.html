		<p>We have done 4 days and 3 nights with Sapa O'Chau guys and it was just exactly what we wanted to experience. They really did listen and helped us to select the best hiking options. Our guides Lu (nature and village trecking itinerary) and May (visiting red lao village) were superb: knowelgeble, funny, caring and very hospitable. Thank you very much for all your energy and good will. Special thanks to the head office staff of sapa o'chau. You were very helpfull, patient and accommodating with all our questions and needs. The best of luck for the future. P.s the guides speak amazing English. Not only we could converse, but also exchange very funny jokes.</p>

		<p>The 8km trek from Sapa, Lao Chai and Ta Van was a photographerâ€™s delight. With breathtaking scenery along the way, one had little time to ponder on the hilly terrain. Good sturdy walking shoes are a must and a walking stick would greatly assist when descending some of the steep tracks. If you are fortunate enough some of the local villagers will assist you along the way</p>
